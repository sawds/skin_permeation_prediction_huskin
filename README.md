# skin_permeation_prediction_huskin
A short project generating models to predict skin permeation constants. Models trained on the Huskin database

The models created here have accuracy competative with the current literature and the model used by EPA.

Please see the .pdf for an intro to the project, and the Jupyter notebook for the methods and results.
